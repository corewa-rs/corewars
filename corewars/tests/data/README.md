# Test Redcode Warriors

These files exist to test the program against real-world examples of warriors,
all freely available online.

## Directory Structure

- `input`: used for reading warrior files
- `expected_output`: the expected "load file" format for a given output. Matches the `input` directory structure approximately one-to-one
  > TODO: These load files were mostly generated by the existing code, creating a tautological test. They really ought to be generated by a third party source e.g. [corewar.io](https://www.corewar.io) or a proper pMARS

Within each directory are some subdirectories:

### Unimplemented

This directory matches the main directory structure but acts as a placeholder for
tests cases that will fail without some feature support (mostly, `FOR` macros).

### Simple

Some "non-real-world" warriors created to exercise specific codepaths, or perform
a kind of smoke test.

### Wilkie

Taken from [Wilkie's benchmark](http://www.koth.org/wilkies/) on KOTH.

### WilMoo Benchmark

Taken from the [WilMoo benchmar](http://www.koth.org/wilmoo/) on KOTH.
