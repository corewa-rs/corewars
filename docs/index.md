# corewa_rs
A Rust implementation of [Core Wars](http://www.koth.org/index.html).

The implementation is based on [this introductory guide](http://vyznev.net/corewar/guide.html) to Redcode, as well as the [pMARS '94 reference](http://corewa.rs/pmars-redcode-94.txt) and an [annotated version](http://corewa.rs/icws94.txt) of the ICWS '94 draft.

## Crates
* [corewa_rs](http://corewa.rs/crates/corewa_rs) - the main implementation
* [testutils](http://corewa.rs/crates/testutils) - some utilities for working with load files and testing complex predicates

## Syntax Highlighting

* A syntax highlighting [plugin](http://github.com/ian-h-chamberlain/corewa_rs/redcode/README.md) for Redcode
