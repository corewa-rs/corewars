# corewa_rs
A Rust implementation of [Core Wars](http://www.koth.org/index.html).

The implementation is based on [this introductory guide](http://vyznev.net/corewar/guide.html) to Redcode, as well as the [pMARS '94 reference](http://corewa.rs/pmars-redcode-94.txt) and an [annotated version](http://corewa.rs/icws94.txt) of the ICWS '94 draft.
