# Redcode Syntax highlighting

Basic syntax highlighting for Redcode, the language used in [Core Wars](https://corewa.rs).

## Features

Syntax highlighting for redcode, based partially on [this vim syntax file](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1705), and on the [pMARS '94 reference](https://corewa.rs/pmars-redcode-94.txt) and an [annotated version](http://corewa.rs/icws94.txt) of the ICWS '94 draft.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.2

Merged into the corewa.rs repository. It's probably easier to maintain this here instead of a separate github repo.

### 0.0.1
